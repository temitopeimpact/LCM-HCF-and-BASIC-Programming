# LCM,HCF and BASIC Programming
 eLearning course designed to help students understand mathematical concepts such as multiples, Least Common Multiple (LCM), and Highest Common Factor (HCF) while learning how to apply QBASIC programming to solve these problems.  Through guided practice, coding simulations, real-time activities, and debugging exercises, learners develop both mathematical reasoning and foundational programming skills in a practical and engaging way.  This course bridges the gap between mathematics and computer programming, helping students think logically, solve problems efficiently, and build confidence in coding.
