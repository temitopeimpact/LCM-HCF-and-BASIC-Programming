Through guided practice, coding simulations, real-time activities, and debugging exercises, learners develop both mathematical reasoning and foundational programming skills in a practical and engaging way.

This course bridges the gap between mathematics and computer programming, helping students think logically, solve problems efficiently, and build confidence in coding.</description><keywords /><slidemeta moniker="slide" monikerplural="slides" viewslides="120" slidecountdescription="120 slides" /><author name="Tope Michael OLOGUNADA" email="" website="" /><application name="Articulate Storyline" version="3.110.36211.0" xmlversion="4.0" /></project></meta>
